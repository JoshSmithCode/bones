# bones

##### _Not quite bare bones, there's a little meat here_

Still a work in progress, but basically usable (kinda). Designed to be a quick and simple launchpad for rapid prototyping. Using PHP7 and Elm 0.18

##### Currently Working
- Basic DI container
- Basic console application
- Basic doctrine entities (default naming strategy, basic migrations via cli)
- Basic Authentication (public/private routes)
- Twig for basic templating
- Example Elm 0.18 app and shell script for file-watching elm-make


##### @todo
- Documentation (some comments included)
- Example Elm 0.18 SPA demonstrating routing
- ???
